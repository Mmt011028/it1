  Lack of Market Research:
  <br>
  First, the samples on the network are difficult to be truly representative.

The Internet is an extremely open space where anyone can participate. In addition, most Internet users belong to young, high-income, urbanized and highly educated groups. Therefore, online survey is limited by the characteristics of online audience, and the group it represents may be limited.
  <br>
Second, the survey results are subject to the survey object.
On the Internet, the respondents participated in the survey on the principle of complete voluntariness. Whether the questionnaire of online survey can be retrieved depends on the respondents' interest in the survey project; The questionnaire may also be repeated. This will affect the reliability of the survey results and the accuracy of the samples to a certain extent.
